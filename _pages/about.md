As a Data Analyst I spend a lot of my time manipulating and analyzing data with SQL and Python and visualizing and presenting data with Power BI/Tableau and ArcGIS. One of the things I love about being a Data Analyst is that throughout my career and even at present I've been given many opportunities to improve my understanding of all the tools I use and to learn new concepts and skills on a frequent basis by applying them to several of the projects that I've worked on. 

Working in local government for over 3 years in this capacity has provided me with unique experiences in managing multiple projects and requests across a wide array of different stakeholder groups with varying levels of comfort with data. Addressing the needs of all these stakeholders in ways that fulfill the criteria that each of their requests demand I find is often a challenging but fun exercise in problem solving both in managing stakeholder relationships and nitty-gritty, technical data work.

My approach to doing this kind of technical data work has been heavily influenced by my Physics degree where I see every project as a problem with a base case and numerous clever ways to achieve your desired results.
