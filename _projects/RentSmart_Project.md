The RentSmart Dashboard was a project that I spent 10 weeks working on as a fellow in the inaugural Civic Innovation Corps cohort in Coding It Forward. <a href="https://codingitforward.com/">Coding It Forward</a> is an organization that pairs young technologists with local and federal government agencies to give them the opportunity to use their skills to work on impactful projects. 

I joined the Civic Innovation Corps and was paired with the City of Boston as a Data Analyst Fellow to work on recreating the popular RentSmart website as a Tableau dashboard. The impetus for this project was the fact that the original website was hosted on Heroku and the City would be losing access to the hosting service in the near future and thus RentSmart would no longer be available to the general public. 

The RentSmart dataset was an amalgamation of complaint and violation data, originally formatted as a JSON file, for every property within the City of Boston and the website would allow the general public to search for those properties and see all the instances of complaints and violations to allow them to make more informed, data driven rental decisions. 

As a Data Analyst Fellow working on the RentSmart project provided me with a great opportunity to learn more advanced SQL by working with a complex dataset that required extensive data transformations to power the dashboard and to gain experience producing a polished dashboard in Tableau intended for use by the general public.

Following the City of Boston's switch from Tableau to Power BI as its main business intelligence tool, the RentSmart Tableau dashboard was rebuilt and redesigned in Power BI in January 2024. This rebuild effort provided further opportunities to improve my skills in dashboard creation by learning how to create RentSmart and all its useful features on another dashboading tool with its own technological idiosyncrasies. The current version of the RentSmart dashboard can be found <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/analytics-team/rentsmart-boston">here</a>.
